          I&apos;m a Computer Science studnet with a solid foundation in
          JavaScript, specializing in React. Over the past year and a half,
          I&apos;ve gained experience building functional UIs and integrating
          APIs for dynamic applications. While my projects are simple, I&apos;m
          committed to continuous learning and expanding my skills, which also
          include basic experience with backend technologies like Node.js,
          Express, and SQL databases.
